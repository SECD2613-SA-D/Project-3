# Topic: Online Restaurant Reservation System

# 1.0 Overview of the Project

    Formerly we talked about the Online reservation system which allows customers to make reservations online,
    check table availability, and receive confirmation emails for a smooth dining experience.
    We mainly focused on automated confirmation emails using user information from the website
    and generating a display of available tables for designated time slots.
    
# 2.0 Problem Statement

    Furthermore, the problem statement included a discussion about miscommunication, overbooking, and the struggles of canceling.
    
# 3.0 Proposed Solution
    
    As a solution, we mentioned creating a user interface that will include a list of restaurants, a reservation form, and a user account.
    For easy cancellation, the button will be visibly present beside the reservations, and SMS/emails will be sent to confirm successful cancellation.
    The information-gathering process to identify flaws comprises questionnaires and interviews.
    
# 4.0 Current Business Process/Workflow
    
    There were further discussions about the current business process and we portrayed 2 scenarios- online reservations and cancellations of reservations.
    In addition to that functional requirements involve input, process, and output.
    On the other hand, non-functional requirements included performance and control.
    
# 5.0 Logical DFD (AS-IS)
    
    For the Logical DFD AS-IS System, we created the context diagram, diagram 0, and child diagram(cancellation management).
    Throughout this study, we aimed to understand the existing system's features and functionalities, its limitations, and possible improvements.
