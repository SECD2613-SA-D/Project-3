# Topic: Online Restaurant Reservation System

# 1.0 Overview of the Project

      Formerly we talked about the Online reservation system which allows customers to make reservations online, check table availability,
      and receive confirmation emails for a smooth dining experience. We mainly focused on automated confirmation emails using user 
      information from the website and displaying available tables for designated time slots. Furthermore, we concentrated on 
      the problem statements and solutions. The information-gathering process to identify flaws comprises questionnaires and interviews.
      There were further discussions about the current business process. In addition to that functional requirements involve input, process,
      and output. On the other hand, non-functional requirements included performance and control. We created a context diagram, diagram 0,
      and a child diagram(cancellation management) for the Logical DFD AS-IS System. Throughout this study, we aimed to understand the existing 
      system's features and functionalities, its limitations, and possible improvements.

    
# 2.0 Problem Statement
      Certain restaurants continue to use antiquated reservation techniques like walk-ins or phone calls, which can result in miscommunications,
      duplicate bookings, and lengthy confirmation wait times. Canceling reservations is cumbersome as customers must contact the restaurant directly,
      leading to mismanagement and missed rebooking opportunities. This ineffectiveness may reduce income. An online reservation system allows users to
      easily check available tables, and make, alter, and cancel bookings using an interactive interface. Restaurants can improve communication by automating 
      reservation reminders and confirmations. To raise output and satisfy clients, they can also gather data and insights.

    
# 3.0 Proposed Solution
      With a well-thought-out user interface, we hope to improve the eating experience for both customers and employees and maximize table management.
      The system will contain a restaurant list with information such as location and hours, and a reservation form with date and time options. Customers
      can create accounts to alter or cancel reservations, and the database will update the status to "Canceled" and free up the time slot. Secure authentication
      and encryption will protect data privacy. SMS and email services will deliver booking confirmations, reminders, and cancellation notices. Reservation
      management systems will allow staff to check upcoming reservations and contact customers as needed.

    
# 4.0 Current Business Process/Workflow
    
     In the current business process, we portrayed 2 scenarios- online reservations and cancellations of reservations.
     In the first scenario, clients book online by providing their information on the restaurant's website. The system 
     looks up table availability; if it is, it sends an email to confirm the reservation; if not, it provides alternate 
     times or a waiting list. The host or hostess verifies reservations and seats guests using the system on the day of
     the reservation. In the second scenario, guests alert the restaurant to a reservation cancellation. The customer 
     receives a cancellation confirmation and the host releases the table by updating the system. 
     In addition to that functional requirements involve input, process, and output. On the other hand, 
     non-functional requirements included performance and control.
    
# 5.0 Logical DFD (AS-IS)
    
    For the Logical DFD AS-IS System, we created the context diagram, diagram 0, and child diagram(cancellation management).

# 9.0 Summary of the proposed system.
   In this investigation, we examined the capabilities, drawbacks, and possible enhancements of the current system. We mapped functional and non-functional
   requirements, workflows, and other information using DFD diagrams to guide the design and implementation stages. This study offers a project scope to 
   direct the creation of an effective and profitable online reservation system that satisfies needs and addresses identified problems.
